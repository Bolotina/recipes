INGREDIENTS
3-4 Wild Sockeye Salmon fillets (the largest one was about 1″ thick)
2 lemons, juice one and slice the other one
1-2 tablespoons Nanami Togarashi (assorted chili pepper)
Sea Salt, to taste
Pepper, to taste (my picky husband prefers a heavy hand)
1 cup water

DIRECTIONS
Season the salmon with the lemon juice, Nanami Togarashi, sea salt,  and pepper.
Insert the stainless steel steam rack that comes with your Instant Pot to the bottom of the pot with the handles up.
Place the salmon fillets on the steam rack in a single layer (or silicone steamer ). Ours slightly overlapped but didn’t impact the look at taste when they finished cooking.
Pour any leftover lemon juice and seasoning over the fillets.
Add 1 cup of water to the pot, carefully avoiding washing away the seasoning off the salmon fillets.
Cover and lock the lid.
Select “Manual” mode and press the “-” button until it reads 5 minutes. Also make sure to set the top knob to “Sealing” and not “Venting”. You’ll want to reduce the time by 1 minutes for every ¼” smaller than 1″ or increase the time by 1 minute for every ¼” larger than 1″. For example a ¾” salmon fillet will cook for 4 minutes while a 1½” salmon fillet will cook for 7 minutes. Cooking time adapted from Frieda Loves Bread.
The Instant Pot will beep at you when it finishes cooking the salmon.
To avoid over-cooking, move the top knob from “Sealing” to “Venting” to manually release the pressure. Warning: The sound of the pressure releasing frightened me the first time I manually released the pressure. Once all of the pressure releases the steam will no longer come out of the vent and you’ll be able to open the lid.
